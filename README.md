# Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Stats-Models

## Description
Nigerian economies rely on the dollar exchange rate to Naira, and the conversion rate has a strong influence on the Nigerian economy for things like buying goods, paying for services, doing international business, and so on. Over the years, there has been a constant fluctuation in the conversion rate, which causes a lot of dilemmas for Nigerian citizens. The goal of this project is to build a time series or machine learning model that will accurately forecast what the naira rate against the dollar will be in the next 2 weeks, ranging from May 22, 2024, to June 4, 2024. The model used in this noteboook is AutoReg and ARIMA which are common statistical models for time series analysis
